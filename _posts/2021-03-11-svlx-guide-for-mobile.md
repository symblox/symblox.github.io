##### About sVLX Synthetic Assets  

sVLX synthetic asset was launched on VELAS main network on January 5th, 2021. Velas users can receive sVLX tokens by depositing VLX into a Staking VELAS (sVLX) contract. The VLX deposited into the Staking VELAS (sVLX) contract is immediately staked into VELAS Masternodes to generate revenue.  

Additionally, when the user receives their sVLX, they can also participate in Symblox's liquidity mining to receive SYX rewards.  

sVLX synthetic assets provided the basic functionality for pVLX no-loss Lotto. pVLX (Lotto) has been running smoothly since it was launched on January 5, 2021.
